The example data is in `CsvMergeForeignRaw` format which contains the entire temporal graph without filtering/batching.

The `duckdb` directory contains Python and SQL scripts to convert data to other formats (e.g. `CsvComposite` and `CsvMergeForeign`).

To make the schema easier to comprehend, the conversion code performs a bit of extra work, e.g. the `Basic_Person_isLocatedIn_Place` and the `Composite_Person_isLocatedIn_Place` tables are the same. However, the redundancy incurred by this is limited as the number of Persons overall is small.
